## About

Brain Games is a set of console mini-games for training mental arithmetic.

## Install

```sh
$ composer global require martines/brain-games
```

## Start

You can type in command-line:

```sh
$ brain-games
```

and select any game from the main menu,  
or simply type the name of the game you are interested in:

-   **brain-even** - determine if the given number is even or not;
-   **brain-calc** - training of addition, subtraction and multiplication in the mind;
-   **brain-gcd** - find the greatest common divisor of two given numbers;
-   **brain-progression** - find the lost member of arithmetic progression;
-   **brain-prime** - determine if the given number is prime or not;

Each game is played in three rounds. With the first incorrect answer, the game ends.  
Good luck!
